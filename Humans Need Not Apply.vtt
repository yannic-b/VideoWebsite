1
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.990
Every human used to have to hunt or gather
to survive. But humans are smart–ly lazy so

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.680
we made tools to make our work easier. From
sticks, to plows to tractors we’ve gone

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.210
from everyone needing to make food to, modern
agriculture with almost no one needing to

4
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.400
make food — and yet we still have abundance.

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.800
Of course, it’s not just farming, it’s
everything. We’ve spent the last several

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.580
thousand years building tools to reduce physical
labor of all kinds. These are mechanical muscles

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.140
muscles – stronger, more reliable, and more tireless
than human muscles could ever be.

8
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.660
And that's a good thing. Replacing human labor
with mechanical muscles frees people to specialize

9
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.370
and that leaves everyone better off even though
still doing physical labor. This is how economies

10
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.610
grow and standards of living rise.

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.230
Some people have specialized to be programmers
and engineers whose job is to build mechanical

12
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.120
minds. Just as mechanical muscles made human
labor less in demand so are mechanical minds

13
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.990
making human brain labor less in demand.

14
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.809
This is an economic revolution. You may think
we've been here before, but we haven't.

15
00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.498
This time is different.

16
00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.130
## Physical Labor

17
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.619
When you think of automation, you probably
think of this: giant, custom–built, expensive,

18
00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.450
efficient but really dumb robots blind to
the world and their own work. There were a

19
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.450
scary kind of automation but they haven't
taken over the world because they're only

20
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.310
cost effective in narrow situations.

21
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.289
But they are the old kind of automation, this
is the new kind.

22
00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:28.319
Meet Baxter.

23
00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.200
Unlike these things which require skilled
operators and technicians and millions of

24
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.39
dollars, Baxter has vision and can learn what
you want him to do by watching you do it.

25
00:01:37.39 --> 00:01:41.579
And he costs less than the average annual
salary of a human worker. Unlike his older

26
00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.649
brothers he isn't pre–programmed for one specific
job, he can do whatever work is within the

27
00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.399
reach of his arms. Baxter is what might be
thought of as a general purpose robot and

28
00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.579
general purpose is a big deal.

29
00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.848
Think computers, they too started out as highly
custom and highly expensive, but when cheap–ish

30
00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.749
general–purpose computers appeared they quickly
became vital to everything.

31
00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:07.429
A general–purpose computer can just as easily
calculate change or assign seats on an airplane

32
00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.180
or play a game or do anything by just swapping
its software. And this huge demand for computers

33
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.170
of all kinds is what makes them both more
powerful and cheaper every year.

34
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.320
Baxter today is the computer in the 1980s.
He’s not the apex but the beginning. Even

35
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.959
if Baxter is slow his hourly cost is pennies
worth of electricity while his meat–based

36
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.770
competition costs minimum wage. A tenth the
speed is still cost effective when it's a

37
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.610
hundred times cheaper. And while Baxtor isn't
as smart as some of the other things we will

38
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.600
talk about, he's smart enough to take over
many low–skill jobs.

39
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.290
And we've already seen how dumber robots than
Baxter can replace jobs. In new supermarkets

40
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.540
what used to be 30 humans is now one human
overseeing 30 cashier robots.

41
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.820
Or the hundreds of thousand baristas employed
world–wide? There’s a barista robot coming

42
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.959
for them. Sure maybe your guy makes your double–mocha–whatever
just perfect and you’d never trust anyone

43
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.260
else – but millions of people don’t care
and just want a decent cup of coffee. Oh and

44
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.299
by the way this robot is actually a giant
network of robots that remembers who you are

45
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.4000
and how you like your coffee no matter where
you are. Pretty convenient.

46
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.650
We think of technological change as the fancy
new expensive stuff, but the real change comes

47
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.360
from last decade's stuff getting cheaper and
faster. That's what's happening to robots

48
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.230
now. And because their mechanical minds are
capable of decision making they are out–competing

49
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.730
humans for jobs in a way no pure mechanical
muscle ever could.

50
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.670
## Luddite Horses

51
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.179
Imagine a pair of horses in the early 1900s
talking about technology. One worries all

52
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.170
these new mechanical muscles will make horses
unnecessary.

53
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.420
The other reminds him that everything so far
has made their lives easier – remember all

54
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.209
that farm work? Remember running coast–to–coast
delivering mail? Remember riding into battle?

55
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.930
All terrible. These city jobs are pretty cushy
– and with so many humans in the cities there

56
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.400
are more jobs for horses than ever.

57
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.840
Even if this car thingy takes off you might
say, there will be new jobs for horses we

58
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.680
can't imagine.

59
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.240
But you, dear viewer, from beyond 2000 know
what happened – there are still working horses,

60
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.650
but nothing like before. The horse population
peaked in 1915 – from that point on it was

61
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.650
nothing but down.

62
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.899
There isn’t a rule of economics that says
better technology makes more, better jobs

63
00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:24.599
for horses. It sounds shockingly dumb to even
say that out loud, but swap horses for humans

64
00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.389
and suddenly people think it sounds about
right.

65
00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.460
As mechanical muscles pushed horses out of
the economy, mechanical minds will do the

66
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.990
same to humans. Not immediately, not everywhere,
but in large enough numbers and soon enough

67
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.990
that it's going to be a huge problem if we
are not prepared. And we are not prepared.

68
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.990
You, like the second horse, may look at the
state of technology now and think it can’t

69
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.310
possibly replace your job. But technology
gets better, cheaper, and faster at a rate

70
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.289
biology can’t match.

71
00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.520
Just as the car was the beginning of the end
for the horse so now does the car show us

72
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.710
the shape of things to come.

73
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.998
## The Shape Of Things to Come

74
00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:05.999
Self–driving cars aren't the future: they're
here and they work. Self–driving cars have

75
00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.419
traveled hundreds of thousands of miles up
and down the California coast and through

76
00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.198
cities – all without human intervention.

77
00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.870
The question is not if they'll replaces cars,
but how quickly. They don’t need to be perfect,

78
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.580
they just need to be better than us. Humans
drivers, by the way, kill 40,000 people a

79
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.979
year with cars just in the United States.
Given that self–driving cars don’t blink,

80
00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.960
don’t text while driving, don’t get sleepy
or stupid, it easy to see them being better

81
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.779
than humans because they already are.

82
00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:39.150
Now to describe self–driving cars as cars
at all is like calling the first cars mechanical

83
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.900
horses. Cars in all their forms are so much
more than horses that using the name limits

84
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.710
your thinking about what they can even do.
Lets call self–driving cars what they really

85
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.289
are:

86
00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.128
Autos: the solution to the transport–objects–from–point–A–to–point–B
problem. Traditional cars happen to be human

87
00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.669
sized to transport humans but tiny autos can
work in wear houses and gigantic autos can

88
00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.539
work in pit mines. Moving stuff around is
who knows how many jobs but the transportation

89
00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.318
industry in the United States employs about
three million people. Extrapolating world–wide

90
00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.469
that’s something like 70 million jobs at
a minimum.

91
00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.270
These jobs are over.

92
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.370
The usual argument is that unions will prevent
it. But history is filled with workers who

93
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.870
fought technology that would replace them
and the workers always loose. Economics always

94
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.389
wins and there are huge incentives across
wildly diverse industries to adopt autos.

95
00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.749
For many transportation companies, the humans
are about a third of their total costs. That's

96
00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:39.439
just the straight salary costs. Humans sleeping
in their long haul trucks costs time and money.

97
00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:44.690
Accidents cost money. Carelessness costs money.
If you think insurance companies will be against

98
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.689
it, guess what? Their perfect driver is one
who pays their small premium but never gets

99
00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:50.990
into an accident.

100
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.110
The autos are coming and they're the first
place where most people will really see the

101
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.490
robots changing society. But there are many
other places in the economy where the same

102
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.860
thing is happening, just less visibly.

103
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.830
So it goes with autos, so it goes for everything.

104
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.929
## Intellectual Labor

105
00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:06.580
### White Collar Work

106
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.740
It's easy to look at Autos and Baxters and
think: technology has always gotten rid of

107
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.400
low–skill jobs we don't want people doing
anyway. They'll get more skilled and do better

108
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.900
educated jobs – like they've always done.

109
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.580
Even ignoring the problem of pushing a hundred–million
additional people through higher education,

110
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.800
white–collar work is no safe haven either.
If your job is sitting in front of a screen

111
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.110
and typing and clicking – like maybe you're
supposed to be doing right now – the bots

112
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.539
are coming for you too, buddy.

113
00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:37.599
Software bots are both intangible and way
faster and cheaper than physical robots. Given

114
00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:41.960
that white collar workers are, from a companies
perspective, both more expensive and more

115
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.128
numerous – the incentive to automate their
work is greater than low skilled work.

116
00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:51.900
And that's just what automation engineers
are for. These are skilled programmers whose

117
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.759
entire job is to replace your job with a software
bot.

118
00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.939
You may think even the world's smartest automation
engineer could never make a bot to do your

119
00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:03.669
job – and you may be right – but the cutting
edge of programming isn't super–smart programmers

120
00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:08.589
writing bots it's super–smart programmers
writing bots that teach themselves how to

121
00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:11.749
do things the programmer could never teach
them to do.

122
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:15.529
How that works is well beyond the scope of
this video, but the bottom line is there are

123
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:20.249
limited ways to show a bot a bunch of stuff
to do, show the bot a bunch of correctly done

124
00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:23.969
stuff, and it can figure out how to do the
job to be done.

125
00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:28.990
Even with just a goal and no example of how
to do it the bots can still learn. Take the

126
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.679
stock market which, in many ways, is no longer
a human endeavor. It's mostly bots that taught

127
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:37.150
themselves to trade stocks, trading stocks
with other bots that taught themselves.

128
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:37.780
Again: it's not bots that are executing orders
based on what their human controllers want,

129
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.280
it's bots making the decisions of what to
buy and sell on their own.

130
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.390
As a result the floor of the New York Stock
exchange isn't filled with traders doing their

131
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.780
day jobs anymore, it's largely a TV set.

132
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.970
So bots have learned the market and bots have
learned to write. If you've picked up a newspaper

133
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.240
lately you've probably already read a story
written by a bot. There are companies that

134
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.940
are teaching bots to write anything: Sports
stories, TPS reports, even say, those quarterly

135
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.730
reports that you write at work.

136
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.680
Paper work, decision making, writing – a
lot of human work falls into that category

137
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.510
and the demand for human metal labor is these
areas is on the way down. But surely the professions

138
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.450
are safe from bots? Yes?

139
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.650
## Professions

140
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.890
When you think 'lawyer' it's easy to think
of trials. But the bulk of lawyering is actually

141
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.380
drafting legal documents predicting the likely
outcome and impact of lawsuits, and something

142
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.730
called 'discovery' which is where boxes of
paperwork gets dumped on the lawyers and they

143
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.610
need to find the pattern or the one out–of–place
transaction among it all.

144
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:38.700
This can all be bot work. Discovery, in particular,
is already not a human job in many firms.

145
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.420
Not because there isn't paperwork to go through,
there's more of it than ever, but because

146
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.719
clever research bots sift through millions
of emails and memos and accounts in hours

147
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.750
not weeks – crushing human researchers in
terms of not just cost and time but, most

148
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:56.890
importantly, accuracy. Bots don't get sleeping
reading through a million emails.

149
00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.340
But that's the simple stuff: IBM has a bot
named Watson: you may have seen him on TV

150
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.590
destroy humans at Jeopardy — but that was
just a fun side project for him.

151
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.810
Watson's day–job is to be the best doctor
in the world: to understand what people say

152
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:14.250
in their own words and give back accurate
diagnoses. And he's already doing that at

153
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.710
Slone–Kettering, giving guidance on lung cancer
treatments.

154
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.700
Just as Auto don’t need to be perfect – they
just need to make fewer mistakes than humans,

155
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.930
– the same goes for doctor bots.

156
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.99
Human doctors are by no means perfect – the
frequency and severity of misdiagnosis are

157
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.240
terrifying – and human doctors are severely
limited in dealing with a human's complicated

158
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.940
medical history. Understanding every drug
and every drug's interaction with every other

159
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.940
drug is beyond the scope of human knowability.

160
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.450
Especially when there are research robots
whose whole job it is to test 1,000s of new

161
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.300
drugs at a time.

162
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.199
Human doctors can only improve through their
own experiences. Doctor bots can learn from

163
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.930
the experiences of every doctor bot. Can read
the latest in medical research and keep track

164
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.189
of everything that happens to all his patients
world–wide and make correlations that would

165
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.760
be impossible to find otherwise.

166
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.350
Not all doctors will go away, but when doctor
bots are comparable to humans and they're

167
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.850
only as far away as your phone – the need
for general doctors will be less.

168
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.370
So professionals, white–collar workers and
low–skill workers all have something to worry

169
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.180
about.

170
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:21.620
But perhaps you're still not worried because
you're a special creative snowflakes. Well

171
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.910
guess what? You're not that special.

172
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.189
## Creative Labor

173
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:32.840
Creativity may feel like magic, but it isn't.
The brain is a complicated machine – perhaps

174
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.930
the most complicated machine in the whole
universe – but that hasn't stopped us from

175
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.219
trying to simulate it.

176
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.500
There is this notion that just as mechanical
muscles allowed us to move into thinking jobs

177
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.410
that mechanical minds will allow us all to
move into creative work. But even if we assume

178
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:51.270
the human mind is magically creative – it's
not, but just for the sake of argument – artistic

179
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.939
creativity isn't what the majority of jobs
depend on. The number of writers and poets

180
00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.630
and directors and actors and artist who actually
make a living doing their work is a tiny,

181
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:04.550
tiny portion of the labor force. And given
that these are professions that are dependent

182
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:08.609
on popularity they will always be a small
part of the population.

183
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.800
There is no such thing as a poem and painting
based economy.

184
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.270
Oh, by the way, this music in the background
that your listening to? It was written by

185
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.310
a bot. Her name is Emily Howel and she can
write an infinite amount of new music all

186
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.699
day for free. And people can't tell the difference
between her and human composers when put to

187
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.100
a blind test.

188
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:32.120
Talking about artificial creativity gets weird
fast – what does that even mean? But it's

189
00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.800
nonetheless a developing field.

190
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.390
People used to think that playing chess was
a uniquely creative human skill that machines

191
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:44.290
could never do right up until they beat the
best of us. And so it goes for all human talent.

192
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.400
## Conclusion

193
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.219
Right: this might have been a lot to take
in, and you might want to reject it – it's

194
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.610
easy to be cynical of the endless, and idiotic,
predictions of futures that never are. So

195
00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.200
that's why it's important to emphasize again
this stuff isn't science fiction. The robots

196
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.530
are here right now. There is a terrifying
amount of working automation in labs and wear

197
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.470
houses that is proof of concept.

198
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:12.950
We have been through economic revolutions
before, but the robot revolution is different.

199
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.990
Horses aren't unemployed now because they
got lazy as a species, they’re unemployable.

200
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.440
There's little work a horse can do that do
that pays for its housing and hay.

201
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.620
And many bright, perfectly capable humans
will find themselves the new horse: unemployable

202
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.220
through no fault of their own.

203
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.10
But if you still think new jobs will save
us: here is one final point to consider. The

204
00:13:33.10 --> 00:13:38.620
US census in 1776 tracked only a few kinds
of jobs. Now there are hundreds of kinds of

205
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.870
jobs, but the new ones are not a significant
part of the labor force.

206
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.880
Here's the list of jobs ranked by the number
of people that perform them – it's a sobering

207
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.370
list with the transportation industry at the
top. Going down the list all this work existed

208
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:58.450
in some form a hundred years ago and almost
all of them are targets for automation. Only

209
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.660
when we get to number 33 on the list is there
finally something new.

210
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.339
Don't that every barista and officer worker
lose their job before things are a problem.

211
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.100
The unemployment rate during the great depression
was 25%.

212
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:17.100
This list above is 45% of the workforce. Just
what we've talked about today, the stuff that

213
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:22.520
already works, can push us over that number
pretty soon. And given that even our modern

214
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:28.210
technological wonderland new kinds of work
are not a significant portion of the economy,

215
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.990
this is a big problem.

216
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.870
This video isn't about how automation is bad
– rather that automation is inevitable. It's

217
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.960
a tool to produce abundance for little effort.
We need to start thinking now about what to

218
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.130
do when large sections of the population are
unemployable – through no fault of their

219
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:49.220
own. What to do in a future where, for most
jobs, humans need not apply.
